# Loan-Approval-Prediction

This project focuses on predicting loan approvals using machine learning techniques, leveraging the dataset from (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s4e10/overview) [Kaggle Playground Series - Season 4, Episode 10]. The dataset contains information about loan applicants, including demographic details, financial history, loan characteristics, and past repayment behavior.

The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that can assess the likelihood of a loan being approved. Accurately predicting loan approvals can help financial institutions streamline the lending process, reduce manual review efforts, and enhance decision-making efficiency.
